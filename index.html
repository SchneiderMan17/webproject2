            <p>
                Edwin's Heirlooms was established in February of this year. It is my attempt to develop woodworking skills in the hope of one day owning this business full time.
                The art of woodworking is based on the legacy my grandpa has left in my life. That legacy has inspired me to create a business around the projects he made.
                If this business becomes successful, or not, ultimately I hope to inspire the generations after me to hold onto important skills in woodworking 
                crafstmanship.

                Edwin is a retired Navy Officer with 20 years service. He was married to his high school sweetheart for more than 50 years. Once he retired from the Navy,
                He was all in on woodworking. Some of his earliest and best projects included a treehouse for some grandkids that lived nearby, and a gazebo on the property
                of a kennel that he owned and operated. Even at an early age I remember being in my grandfathers work shop. Being involved in Boy Scouts gave us lots of 
                projects to work on. Things like pinewood derby cars and the final Eagle Scout project were hot on his to-dos. There are many opportunities for character 
                growth when working with wood like attention to detail, <strong>patience</strong>, planning, and dealing with failure. These are lessons I hope to teach to my kids and grandkids, 
                all through the environment of a workshop and wood.

        <h2>The Art of Woodworking</h2>
        <p>
            As I grew up I was reminded time and time again the unlimited potential of wood and an idea as we were gifted rocking horses, wagons, and keepsake boxes. 
            You wouldn't have to look very far to see other projects he had made to adorn his own house. All of the projects he made, to give or to keep were 
            made with quality in mind. Sturdy wood, dovetail joints, with paints and varnishes perfectly administered meant that nothing short of disaster would 
            see his work ruined. That's why the motto for this company: "Love Handed Down" adds the foundation that every piece this company makes will have the same
            precision and attention to detail as the next, as if I were giving each of these pieces to my own great-grand children, or putting it in my own house. Heirlooms 
            stand the test of time and are often made with sturdy materials, both to hold the weight of the object itself and all the memories it holds with it.

                "The “material” aspect of this brand of inheritance cements this relationship. The physicality of an unearthed letter or silverware – the touch,
                smell, texture, color, wear, erosion, rust, patina – any and every marker of time, is evocative. It becomes a wormhole to remembering a family
                anecdote, an event, or an individual."- <em>SAUMYA KALIA - <u>click image for article</u></em>
